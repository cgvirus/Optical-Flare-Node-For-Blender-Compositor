Usually you will not need the tranform nodes attached with the images. If you need to tranform your element just unmute it pressing "M" and tweak it. Otherwise it is better to mute it as it takes processing power. Use Property Panel for easy input pressing "N". See the tutorial or ask in forum. Thanks.
